I think doing my CLI project gave my a lot of confidence but I still found myself a little confused in terms of how to start my Sinatra project this felt more bare boned where as in my CLI the basic structure was created through bundle. 
Things got very interesting when you are able to host your own server and you get to see your website come alive. 

The project had a couple of requirements to meet so I decided to build a website that collected video game titles. The user authentication was the hard part and you had to make sure that only users who made the post could delete or edit it. Avi's video helped and had to do a little bit of digging on my own to figure the rest of it out. 

Also, using ruby in HTML forms was a little tricky was in terms of logic but the main thing was to think of user experience. Because you could have the relations and coding and everything but once you actually use the website then you find out what more functionality that you need to add to it. 

The project is the first full MVC app we made from scratch and I would I spent most of my time on the controllers and making sure what I wanted in each and having clear duties.
