One of the reasons why I've always been drawn to coding was because a part of thinkgs like a pogram with stored variables and instances. It just makes life easier. While the other half of my brain is more fluid, I definitely find solace in the fact that there is a part of me that functions like a beautiful systematic program. If you think about it memories and experiences are instances stored in an array and we iterate through them at a fraction of a second. 

For example there could be a method in us somewhere that is named 'fear_of_failure' and everytime we interact with an instance of test the method gets called and we invoke certain actions. Our neurons here make the programming links and in a way of metaprogramming neurons makes connections based on familarity. 

I guess what I am trying to say is whether we like it or not we are all programmed in a certain way and somewhere inside of us we have source code call genes which kind of initializes us.
