My first programming language was Visual Basic. I got to learn it when I was 15 and without anyone telling me I created my first tic-tac-toe game within a few months. The coding was very amateur and involved a lot of copy-pasting. None, the less I was proud of it. 

I enjoyed that I could speak a language that was based on logic and I could create things with this. Coding in itself was a way of self-expression. Donâ€™t ask me how I ended up getting an MBA in Finance. My life just like any other piece of coding went through trials, errors, & tribulations. The joy of creation is what truly makes me happy, and the intellectual thought that follows in such work is what gives me passion and motivation.

When I put it all together, even though I may not understand coding or Ruby in its entirety, just looking at complex pieces of code makes me happy. It has been a long time since I have felt this music passion in an endeavor that I have taken on and so excited to see through this.
