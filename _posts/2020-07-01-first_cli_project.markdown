Let me first start off by saying that less than one week ago I was completely lost on where to start. I didn't even have a local environment setup and neither did I completely understand concepts like API or Scraping entirely. Words like "Nokogiri" would literally scare me because I just didn't understand it and I definitely felt the gap in knowledge. In the beginning, API seemed like the easy route to take because someone has already done some of the work for me, and looking at HTML code brought in its own jargon that I had no clue about. 

I decided to start by setting up my own local environment since that seemed the most daunting process of it all. I didn't want to use learn IDE because I was afraid I might lose my work just because something crashed. Halfway through setting up my local environment it started giving me an error. I decided to give up for the day and try the next day. There was so much information there and I didn't really understand it all. But I kept on and made sure I read the instructions and I got it to work. 

After I set up my local environment I was looking at a blank screen not even knowing where to start. I've done labls before but those were just sections or portions of coding. It never told you how to setup your bin file, or requirements or dependencies in a systematic manner. I've done it before but the information was scattered. Only after watching the first 15 mins of Avi's 'Daily deal' 20 times or more did I finally start to piece things together. 

When I realized how to set up the skeleton of my program through bundler and saw that my files getting generated, I had a huge sigh of relief. I created 4 or 5 different directories not knowing what I was doing. I was googling everything I could so the steps made sense. In preparation, I probably spent 6-7 hours just watching videos and then 20 hours or more in coding. In the end, after going to several sources and with some help I was able to get my program to work. At times I had the skeleton correct but some small syntax or logical error would throw me off entirely. I ended up learning a lot and having a much wider understanding of everything I was afraid of and how everything comes together.
