The most fun lab was probably learning and creating music library. That is where the deeper understanding of methods and class were really tested for me. The entire process of creating methods to create artists, songs and genre was mind boggling. Also, accessing class variables in other ruby files seemed confusing.

What really helped me was the understanding what a method is used for and the scope of instance methods and class methods. The meaning of self kept changing from situation to situation and that too took some time to grasp. 

I would say thinking out loud really helps and talking through the process of how the program works helps put peices together in your head.
